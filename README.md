# Running the test
install depencies with npm `npm ci`
run the developer server could be easiest `npm run dev`
running the production build can be done `npm run build` then `npm run preview`;

# Notes
- I used tailwind for quick styling
- I used vite for the build tooling
- Minimal working version without much css
- No "search" button, it does searching as the user types
- Time spent about 30 minutes.
